/**
Encodes a specific value for one of the traits.

More values can be unlocked over time.

Follows a specific pattern to save redundant
structures:

[TraitID]<delim>[Full Value String]
ยง "bg:red_sunglasses"
  => "Background": "Red Sunglasses"

This allows us to encode everything we need in a single
String instead of via Maps like
{type: background, value: red sunglasses}

We must keep track of all these values, and handle
their resolution to actual prompts on the backend

ยง "bg:clouds"
  => "sunlit clouds in the background"
ยง "bg:underwater"
  => "underwater, surrounded by colorful fishes"
